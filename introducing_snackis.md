# Introducing Snackis
#### Posted May 9th, 2:50 PM

### Snackis
[Snackis](https://github.com/andreas-gone-wild/snackis) is the latest and by far most substantial iteration of an idea I've been working on in one form or other over the last 30 years. A distributed and secure messaging system that uses existing email infrastructure as transport and cuts enough corners to make the experience seemless. [Snackis](https://github.com/andreas-gone-wild/snackis) stores all data locally in encrypted form and comes with a convenient, hacker friendly terminal UI and first-class support for offline use. It is completely self-contained and may be put on a USB-stick for instant secure messaging wherever you are. All functionality offered by the UI is also available through the Golang API.

### Status
This announcement is intended as a preview. The functionality needed for a minimum viable program is operational, but plenty of testing remains before I'm willing to commit to backwards compatibility. The email code is based on Python3's mature email libraries and has seen plenty of use without causing problems; all messages sent from [Snackis](https://github.com/andreas-gone-wild/snackis) are tagged with ```___SNACKIS___``` and processed messages are moved to a folder with the same name to keep the normal inbox clean. You may find preliminary documentation and screen shots [here](https://github.com/andreas-gone-wild/snackis).

### Roadmap
The code needs some time to settle down after this mad rush to get something up and running. I have a few ideas that have been waiting for this kind of platform; distributed scheduling of shared resources to name one. What I can promise will never happen is monetization strategies, manipulation, ads, closed source or any other kind of intrusions into your integrity. This one is by the people, for the people; and if you're anything like me, you're ready for something new. 

### Support
Funding, Code and/or Ideas are more than welcome. Open issues, send requests or email me at andreas.gone.wild@gmail.com, and I'll do my best to follow up. If you have a few coins to spare; [this is your chance](https://www.paypal.me/c4life) to help make a positive difference; attempting a feat like this with a regular job sucking life out of me just wouldn't be possible; every contribution counts. Thank you.

Until next time; be well,
A

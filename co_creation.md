# Secure, Distributed Co-Creation
#### Posted Jul 5th, 11:00 PM

### Intro
Secure and distributed co-creation is something I've been pondering for a while. It's clear to me that connecting, creating and sharing are fundamental human needs. That is the core value provided by Facebook and others, however primitive and compromised they may be. It's also clear to me that the current situation is far from optimal and rapidly getting worse as they tighten their grip on the Internet and find ever more convenient ways of raping the world for profit. [Snackis](https://github.com/andreas-gone-wild/snackis) aims to offer an alternative to the ruling madness; a distributed and secure platform for connecting, creating and sharing; built on top of plain old email and and strong encryption.

### Feeds
Feeds are unique sequences of posts that are distributed to a set of peers, any member may reply and all posts/updates are propagated to current members. Feeds may be used to represent anything from short-lived discussions to channels.

### Projects
Projects are sets of tasks that may be shared among a set of peers. Any member may add tasks to a project, but only the owner is allowed to modify the task/project details. Each project and each task has it's own feed where members may post messages.

### Queues
Queues are sets of tasks that may be shared among a set of peers. Any member may add tasks to a queue, but only the owner is allowed to modify the queue details. A single task may be an item in several queues and a single queue may hold tasks from several projects. Like projects and tasks, each queue has it's own feed where members may post messages.
